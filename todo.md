### general
- [ ] don't require suffix if only one suffix is possible (at least for some opcodes)
- [ ] don't require suffix on bcc? (try .b, fall back on .w)
- [ ] no-align (name?) directive that disables auto alignment after byte define
- [ ] data defines
- [ ] macros
- [ ] labels can probably not start with an A or a D right now, probably other problems
- [ ] write tests for all opcodes and addressing modes
- [ ] documentation
- [ ] replace todo!() with proper errors
